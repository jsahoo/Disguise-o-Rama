# Disguise-o-Rama Coding Challenge

## Features/Tasks Outline

### Launch Screen
Create a custom launch screen with some text and images.

### Animated Transition from Launch Screen to Main Screen
Create a screen that looks identical to the launch screen. Animate all elements off the screen and zoom Scotch into position.

### Intro Screen/Tutorial
After first launching the app, we need a short intro to explain how the app works to the user. This screen starts off with just Scotch on a white background in the zoomed in position from the previous screen. Next we animate in a text bubble at the top and a "next" button at the bottom. Clicking the "next" button at the bottom changes the text in the text bubble as well as the text for the "next" button. After completing the intro, zoom Scotch out into position and animate out the text bubble and "next" button.

### Main Screen
The main screen is where we actually get to disguise Scotch. Scotch is displayed on a white background in the center of the screen. Small bubbles with each of the different disguise options appear in a circular menu that can be rotated around behind Scotch. Selecting a disguise applies that disguise to Scotch, all of the other disguise bubbles fall to the bottom of the screen, and a title and description for the selected disguise appear at the top of the screen. Tapping on Scotch after he's been disguised removes the current disguise, hides the title and description, and puts all of the disguise bubbles back in the circular menu.
